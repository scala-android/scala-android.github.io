### Project integration test project

If you're stuck with configuration, `jni` integration, multiproject build. Please
check [sbt plugin's examples](https://github.com/scala-android/sbt-android/tree/master/sbt-test/android-sdk-plugin). Plugin is well tested and it's good source of information.

### 3rd party examples

There are some other examples done by other plugin users. You might look at `47deg` projects like:

* Translation bubble [https://github.com/47deg/translate-bubble-android](https://github.com/47deg/translate-bubble-android)
* Scala days Android application [https://github.com/47deg/scala-days-android](https://github.com/47deg/scala-days-android)
* Scala Android API demos [https://github.com/47deg/scala-android](https://github.com/47deg/scala-android)
